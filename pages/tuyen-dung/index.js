                                    His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a
                                    country boy who had never seen Trantor
                                    behtmlFore. That is, not in real life. He had
                                    seen it many times on the hyper-video, and
                                    occasionally in tremendous three-dimensional
                                    newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or
                                    the opening of a Galactic Council. Even
                                    though he had lived all his life on the
                                    world of Synnax, which circled a star at the
                                    edges of the Blue Drift, he was not cut off
                                    from civilization, you see. At that time, no
                                    place in the Galaxy was.

                                    There were nearly twenty-five million
                                    inhabited planets in the Galaxy then, and
                                    not one but owed allegiance to the Empire
                                    whose seat was on Trantor. It was the last
                                    half-century in which that could be said.

                                    To Gaal, this trip was the undoubted climax
                                    of his young, scholarly life. He had been in
                                    space behtmlFore so that the trip, as a voyage
                                    and nothing more, meant little to him. To be
                                    sure, he had traveled previously only as far
                                    as Synnax's only satellite in order to get
                                    the data on the mechanics of meteor driftage
                                    which he needed htmlFor his dissertation, but
